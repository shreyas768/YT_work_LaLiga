# ⚽ La Liga Match Outcome Predictions

This repository contains project focused on predicting La Liga football match outcomes using machine learning. In this part, we perform detailed **data cleaning** and **feature engineering** to prepare the dataset for modeling.

## 📌 What's Covered in Part 1?

- Data preprocessing on raw match data
- Creating rolling averages for match stats
- Engineering features like:
  - Team form (last 5 matches)
  - Head-to-head win percentage
  - Shot accuracy and xG differential
- Generating the binary classification target
- Setting up predictors for model training

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🧠 Target

We create a target variable indicating whether the team won (`1`) or not (`0`), to be used in the binary classification model.

## 📁 Files

- `La_Liga_project.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all processing and feature steps
- `matches_full.csv` – Raw dataset
